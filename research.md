My research focuses on in nongovernmental organization and provision of public services in the United States. 

I explore the following issues at the intersection of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and democratic governance: 
 
 Does public sector reliance on NGOs impact access and accountability?  
 How do NGOs shape policy? 
 When do public-private partnerships augment - or alleviate - existing inequalities in public service provision?
