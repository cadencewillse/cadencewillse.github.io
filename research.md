My research focuses on in nongovernmental organization and provision of public services in the United States. 

I focus on following questions on the relationship between nongovernmental organizations and democratic governance: 
 Does public sector reliance on nongovernmental organizations impact access and accountability?  
 How do nongovernmental organizations shape policy? 
 When do public-private partnerships augment - or alleviate - existing inequalities in public service provision?
