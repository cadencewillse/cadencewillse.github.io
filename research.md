My research focuses on how non-profit and for-profit organizations shape educational and environmental policy in the U.S.

My research addresses the following questions: Does public sector reliance on NGOs impact access and accountability?   How do NGOs shape policy? When do public-private partnerships augment - or alleviate - existing inequalities in public service provision?
