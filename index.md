Hello! I am a political scientist studying philanthropy and policy. My research focuses on how non-profit and for-profit organizations shape educational and environmental policy. I am an [Assistant Professor](https://polisci.tcnj.edu/faculty_staff/cadence-willse/) of Political Science at The College of New Jersey. Prior to joining the faculty at TCNJ, I was a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/person/cadence-willse/) in the Digital Civil Society Lab at the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University.

I recently received my PhD from Brown University, where I was a [Graduate Fellow in Community Engaged Scholarship at the Swearer Center](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/swearer/people/graduate-fellows-assistants/cadence-willse) and a [Graduate Assistant at the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy](https://watson.brown.edu/taubman/people/cadence-willse). I received my B.A. in History and Political Science from St. Mary's College of Maryland, and my M.A. in Urban Education Policy and Political Science from Brown University.  Prior to attending Brown, I worked for a nonprofit focused on college access for low-income students in the Boston Public Schools.
