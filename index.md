Hello! I am a political scientist studying interest groups, philanthropy and policy. I'm thrilled to join the Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University this fall as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

My research focuses on issues of equity, access, and representation in interest groups politics.  My current book project explores the changing role of civic advocacy in American politics, focusing on the rapid increase in philanthropy in public schools. 

In addition, I am working on two coauthored papers: one focuses on policy engagement on social media, and the other focuses on the implications of national policy expansion and economic volatility for subnational and nongovernmental capacity.  In addition, I am passionate about community-engaged scholarship, teaching and student development, and I have coauthored a forthcoming article and book chapter on the topic.

I recently received my PhD from Brown University, where I was a [Graduate Fellow in Community Engaged Scholarship at the Swearer Center](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/swearer/people/graduate-fellows-assistants/cadence-willse) and a [Graduate Assistant at the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy](https://watson.brown.edu/taubman/people/cadence-willse). I received my B.A. in History and Political Science from St. Mary's College of Maryland, and my M.A. in Urban Education Policy and Political Science from Brown University.  Prior to attending Brown, I worked for a nonprofit focused on college access for low-income students in the Boston Public Schools.
