My research focuses on issues of equity, access, and representation in interest groups politics.  My dissertation explores the changing role of civic advocacy in American politics, focusing on the rapid increase in philanthropy in public schools. 

In addition, I am working on two coauthored papers on on the role of governing capacity in reform durability and retrenchment, and the implications of national policy expansion and economic volatility for subnational and nongovernmental capacity.  

I received my B.A. in History and Political Science from St. Mary's College of Maryland, and her M.A. in Urban Education Policy and Political Science from Brown University.  Prior to attending Brown, I worked at nonprofit working with low-income students in the Boston Public Schools. At present, I am a [Graduate Fellow in Community Engaged Scholarship at the Swearer Center](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/swearer/people/graduate-fellows-assistants/cadence-willse) and a [Graduate Assistant at the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy](https://watson.brown.edu/taubman/people/cadence-willse) at Brown University.
