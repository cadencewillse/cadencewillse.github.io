Hello! I am an [Assistant Professor](https://polisci.tcnj.edu/faculty_staff/cadence-willse/) of Political Science at The College of New Jersey, and my research focuses on U.S. public policy. 

Prior to joining the faculty at TCNJ, I was a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/person/cadence-willse/) in the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University. I received my PhD from Brown University, where I was a Graduate Fellow in Community Engaged Scholarship at the Swearer Center and a Graduate Assistant at the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy.
