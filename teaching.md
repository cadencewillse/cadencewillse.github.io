My academic training and professional experience allows me to teach introductory and advanced courses in American politics and public policy. In addition to my experience as a teaching assistant and course instructor, I worked for a non-profit organization that prepared first-generation students for success in college before graduate school. I am passionate about student engagement with the community and improving diversity and inclusion in higher education.
